Here is a description of the code used in the study "Targeting GPX4 to Induce Ferroptosis Overcomes Chemoresistance Mediated by the PAX8-AS1/GPX4 Axis in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma."


Code1. Differential expression analysis.R: This script conducts differential expression analysis of transcriptomic data using the limma R package to identify differentially expressed genes.

Code2. Volcano plot.R: This script visualizes the results of the differential gene expression analysis using the ggplot2 R package.

Code3. Heatmap.R: This script uses the ComplexHeatmap R package to visualize expression data as heatmaps.

Code4. Correlation analysis of sample expression profiles.R: This script performs correlation analysis of transcriptomic profiles across samples using the Spearman and visualizes the results with the pheatmap R package.

Code5. Survival analysis.R: This script performs Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using the survival R package.
